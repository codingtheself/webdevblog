# Day 1

Creating this simple blog with just HTML right now and posting what I have learned today and everything on Day 1 post.

This site for now will be using the *GitHub page* to host this site as it is just a *Static Site* (which just means that there is no extra rendering happening and you will see exactly what I wrote)

Quite different from dynamic sites where you can login to an account and then, will see the blogs you have created specifically and there is rendering of pages like when you search something.
