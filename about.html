            <h2><u>Who?</u></h2>
            <p>
                Hey, <br>
                <br>

                I am <b>Sourav Yadav</b>,
                <br><br>
                and I am a currently 3rd Year College Student, pursuing <i>Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science (B.Tech CSE) and Engineering specializing in Data Science. I am from West Bengal, India</i>

                <br><br>
                I have been into programming and coding since, I was 11 years old.<br> <br>
                I got started on it by creating some simple <i>Batch Scripts</i> which can run multiple commands on windows command prompt one by one.

                <br><br>
                Then, later I found out web development as at that time, the Internet was booming quite fast.

                <br><br>
                I learned some basics of HTML and CSS and even Javascript from a YouTuber: <i>Bucky Robert</i> from <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thenewboston">Thenewboston</a></b> (YouTube Channel).

                <br><br>
                Then, there was a cool website called: <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a></b>

                <br><br>
                I also recommend the above website if you are a beginner and also wants to learn or get started with programming or web development in general.

                <br><br>
                But now since, I am in my 3rd year of college I am looking to become the Best Developer and get a Job.

                <br><br>
                The web Technology has changed and also keeps changing faster and faster each second like I remember using <i>XMLHttpRequests</i> and PHP but now we have tons of options like <i>NodeJS, ExpressJS, Django, Flask, .NET Blazors</i>, etc.

                <br><br>
                Okay, enough talk. Let's move on
            </p>

            <h2><u>What?</u></h2>

            <p>
                This is a challenge where I will be creating this blog increasingly more feature-rich and also create other side projects with the knowledge I gain in this journey.

                <br><br>
                I will posting blog posts from <a href="posts/day01.html">Day 01</a>, document everything from resources I use, to things I learned and challenges I face.

                <br><br>

                It will be exciting journey and I hope few things from this:

                <ul>
                    <li>By the end of <i>Day 100</i>, I would have transformed this blog into full-fledged blog site or my portfolio website with modern Tech Stacks</li>
                    <br>

                    <li>Learn and gain actual experience of Web Development and Software Engineering</li>

                    <br>

                    <li>Get a Job or Paid Internship</li>

                    <br>

                    <li>Meet and Connect with like-minded Devs in the Community. Or maybe, we can create our own community</li>

                    <br>

                    <li>Help and Inspire other Devs to get out of the <b>Tutorial hell</b> and challenge ourselves to create actual worthwhile or cool stuffs (as that's the best way to learn coding) and most importantly. <b>HAVE Fun!</b></li>

                </ul>
            </p>
