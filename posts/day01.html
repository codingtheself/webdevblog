            <h3><u>What's my Goal here</u></h3>

            <p>
                My Goal is here is to <i>learn web development</i> and I was stuck in the <b>Tutorial Hell</b> for too long. I am frustated that I have joined lots of courses, watched lots of YouTube videos and also created lots of websites using HTML, CSS, Javascript and even PHP. <br>
                
                <br>
                But still when it comes to creating actual worthwhile project or full-fledged website I didn't created any till now. So, here is the challenge I took on myself.<br>

                <br>
                Where I will be learning again the web development (right now many things have come like MERN stack and Django and many more But I will starting from scratch).<br>
                
                <br>
                And <b>whatever I learn, I will document it on my blog which I will be creating as I go and learn more.</b>

                <br>
                <br>
                And that's why I setup this <i>GitHub Page</i> to host my blog which is right now just plain HTML and minimum CSS (inline).

                <br>
                <br>

                And by the end of this challenge maybe on <b>Day 101</b> I will have transformed this entire site into a full-fledged blog site using the modern tech stack like <i>MERN Stack</i><br>

                <br>

            <h3><u>Challenges I faced today</u></h3>

            Well, I realized how convenient <i>templating</i> things make. Like I had to create multiple HTML files but there was lot of overlap as there was many codes which are just repeating and I want them to repeat.

            <br><br>
            Like the navbar above, I want it to remain the same or consistent and so I have to copy the entire thing again and again to every HTML page. Unlike in php where I can just do <code>include();</code> and that's it.

            <br><br>

            and so, the first thing I will try to find is if I can do <b>templating in plain HTML</b>.

            <br><br>

            Second, I realized that if I update my website and thought of using a database for my posts then, how will I do that? It is all HTML file where I am just writing my post.

            <br><br>

            I would have to parse the HTML file to extract the content of the blog post and then, maybe convert it to <i>MarkDown Files</i> and then, I can save it on the database. Yeah that seems like a good idea.

            <h3><u>What I created and Learned so Far</u></h3>

            <p>
                Well, You are already looking what I have created so far within maybe <b>2.5+ hour</b> of work.
            
                <br><br>

                here is the image below of my code editor, editing this HTML page:
                <br><br>

                <figure style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="../assets/images/day01-image.png" alt="my VS code editor where I am editing this HTML post page" width="600" height="450"/>

                    <figcaption style="font-size: small;">VS Code editor, where I am editing this HTML post page</figcaption>
                </figure>


            </p>

            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>The first thing I learned is that: <i>MDN web docs</i> are very good and useful. They are great and I have used it for reference and I would suggest you to learn how to read and use these docs. <br>
                    here, try to find what you want know: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">MDN Web Docs HTML</a>
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>I have only used little bit of CSS inline in the HTML tags directly instead of using external CSS file right now. As I go and this blog becomes large, I will be needing it soon</li>

                <br>

                <li>I have also created a <i>assets</i> folder where I can place my images I will be using and also css files would go there. You can go ahead and check the code in my <a href="https://github.com/codingtheself/webdevblog">GitHub repo</a></li>
            </ul>
