         <h3><u>Problems I Faced</u></h3>

         <ul>
          <li>
            Yesterday, <i>none</i> of the routes were working â€” the browser was blank, and no components showed up.
            <br><br>
            Turns out, I wasnâ€™t passing the correct <code>routes</code> config to the router.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Today, I fixed it by creating a <code>router.js</code> file and explicitly defining the route-component mapping like this:
            <pre><code>{`import Home from './pages/Home.svelte';
import About from './pages/About.svelte';
import Day04 from './pages/Day04.svelte';

const routes = {
    '/home': Home,
    '/about': About,
    '/post/day04': Day04,
};

export default routes;`}
</code></pre>
          </li>

          <br>
          <li>
            Then I imported and used it inside <code>App.svelte</code>:
            <pre><code>{`<script>
  import Router from "svelte-spa-router";
  import NavBar from "./pages/NavBar.svelte";
  import routes from './router.js';

  console.log('Active route:', routes);
</script>

<NavBar />;

<main class="main-body">
  <Router {routes} />
</main>`}
</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

         <h3><u>What I've Learned</u></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I finally understood how <code>svelte-spa-router</code> works â€” defining and passing routes is crucial. And I could now build these file by:
            <br><br>
            <code>
                npm run build
            </code>

            <br><br>
            this will create your static site files inside the <code>dist/</code> folder.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Was trying how to use <i>OpenGL</i> in C to create some GUI windows but I got stuck at setting up and linking <code>GLFW.h</code> and other libraries. As C and C++ doesn't seem to have a convenient package manager. Maybe in the Future I will try to create it.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            I also read an amazing article: <a href="https://yoan-thirion.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/software-craftsmanship/the-programmers-brain"><b>The Programmerâ€™s Brain</b></a> â€” it discusses how we process and understand code. I highly recommend it to any dev feeling stuck while learning.
          </li>
        </ul>
