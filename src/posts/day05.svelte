      <h3><u>Problems I Faced</u></h3>

        <ul>

          <li>
            I started rewriting my this original HTML blog to integrate <b><a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/overview">Svelte</a></b>. But got stuck while trying to add images.
            <br><br>
            For some reason, the image paths aren't rendering correctly in the generated HTML. Need to debug that soon.
          </li>

          <br>

          <li>
            Another thing: I can navigate between pages using <code>use:link</code> on anchor tags, but directly visiting URLs like <code>/post/day05</code> doesn't render the right page (404).
            <br><br>
            Maybe it's something with hash-based routing or the Vite server setup. Will dive deeper tomorrow.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <br>

       <h3><u>What I've Learned</u></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Creating small, reusable components in Svelte using <code>&lt;slot /&gt;</code>
          </li>

          <br>

          <li>
            Started creating a Markdown-To-HTML converter in NodeJS to help me write blog posts by only writing markdown and it will generate the appropriate HTML file which I can use.
          </li>
          <br>

          <li>
            CLI tools feel fun to build. Even if it's just parsing markdown and printing HTML â€” seeing the result instantly is awesome.
          </li>
        </ul>
